				<h3>"When Chickenheads Come Home To Roost" Book Review</h3>
				<p>
					<img class="blogimg" src="blogs/reviews/chickenheadsbookcover.jpg" alt="chickenheads book cover" /><br>
					I love that there are books like these to help us to understand ourselves and share our experiences although I found that I disliked the same points in this book that I disliked in Brittany Cooper's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33574165-eloquent-rage?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=1VZk6dDSey&rank=1">"Eloquent Rage"</a>. I don't believe intimate relationships should have taken up so much space. I also disliked the spirit of elitism which the author attempted to avoid, yet and still it lingered throughout. I would like to think the main point of feminism is to afford women the freedom to be individuals and evaluated on a case by case basis. This is including but not limited to being freed from the discrimination bred by a man's limited perspective and freedom from subjugation due to his inability to see our value.
					I did appreciate this book and we all wanted to love it but I finished this book feeling more frustrated than liberated. She explains how black women, knowing the hardships that have formed many black men to be toxic, should love and support them from a distance without always inviting them intimately..and she should have stopped there. She goes on to discuss how the black family is broken, the lessons her mother gave her on relationships, and whether men should also have rights to unborn children. Morgan was truly on to something, but she never quite got there.  Black feminist are tasked with maintaining an allegiance to black lives matter, a movement which holds it protests with the strength of black women at its foundation but places her secondary more often than equal. These are the matters I was hoping the author would express touch on with a possible deviation in perspective. I was disappointed that she encouraged woman to stroke the egos of men as long as it proves to be mutually beneficial. This includes the arguement of letting him pay the bill because if you paid his ego would bruised or he wouldnt feel like he was a man. I thought the entire point of feminism was to effectively say "I should'nt have to be less of me for you to be more of you". If you want to let your man pay for dinner because youre selfish, broke, or want to be appreciated, then do it.
					BUT! if you have to let your man pay for dinner simply because he would be emasculated by not doing so, or for the fear of being viewed as masculine yourself, then expect to subjugated to his masculinity for the duration of the relationship. The latter part of this book is all about compromises with men of this sort. Women that are on this side of the field will compromise because they feel like being themselves runs the already limited available men away.. and it does. But should we have such a crippling fear of being single that the compromises we make with men compromise ourselves? I think not. Paying for dinner is not apart of who i am but where will this man's mindstate lead you? Suppression and servitude is the answer. The solution is not compromise but to stop placing so much emphasis on intimate monogamous relationships. Intimacy is not a cause for which you should sell soul for...but, more on this later. 
					I expected clarity and representation and with the reverence this book was given, i generally expected more.
