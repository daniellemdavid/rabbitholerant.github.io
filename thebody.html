				<h3>"The Body" by Bill Bryson<br> Book Review</h3>
				<p>
					<img class="blogimg" src="the body book cover HERE" alt="The Body book cover" /><br>
					This book is a for sure winner! The body puts so many things into perspective and I found myself saying "oh wow" so many times throughout this book. I would call this "The lazy doctors guide to the body" or it could be a perfect "cliff notes" for the body. Very consise and well written, this book flows from one body part to the next seemlessly. Only bad note I have about this book is that there just wasnt enough. I would have liked to have a second expanded version of this book that goes more in depth with each portion of the body. I seriously believe that most people would enjoy this book and emerge from the pages feeling a little more sure of themselves.
